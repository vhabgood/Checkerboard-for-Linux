The build process completed successfully, with only warnings about potential string truncation. This indicates that all compilation errors related to the EGDB initialization should be resolved.

Please run the `checkerboard_app` from the `ResourceFiles` directory and provide the contents of `app.txt`. This will allow me to confirm that the EGDB initialization no longer crashes and to analyze the log for any new EGDB-related errors or successful initialization messages.

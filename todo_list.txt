# TODO List for Checkers Application

## GUI and Game Logic Implementation:

*   **COMPLETED: All fundamental game logic (move validation, game state updates, win/loss conditions like time-outs, no legal moves, three-fold repetition, 50-move rule, and basic insufficient material) is correctly implemented and integrated with the GUI. Further refinements for PDN move validation robustness and explicit handling of resign/draw offers can be considered in future development.**
*   **COMPLETED: Remaining UI elements and their functionalities (menus, dialogs, etc.) have been reviewed. Placeholder functions for `gameFindTheme()`, `gameSaveAsHtml()`, `gameFindPlayer()`, and `engineAbout()` have been updated with more informative messages. `cmEngineCommand()` now allows user input. Language options are deferred for future development.**

## AI Re-implementation:
*   **COMPLETED: The `minimax` function in `GeminiAI.cpp` includes alpha-beta pruning and quiescence search. Further enhancements will be considered as part of AI tuning.**
*   **COMPLETED: Move generation is handled by `makemovelist` and related capture functions in `c_logic.c`, called via `get_legal_moves_c`. These functions have been refactored for efficiency.**
*   **COMPLETED: Integrate the internal AI with the `GameManager` to allow AI vs. Human and AI vs. AI games.**
*   **COMPLETED: Implement engine communication for external engines (sending commands, parsing responses, handling different engine protocols if necessary).**

## EGDB Integration:
*   **COMPLETED: Integrate the endgame database (`dblookup.c`) with the AI to improve endgame play. This includes: Calling `db_init` and `db_exit` at appropriate times. Using `dblookup` to query the EGDB for moves/evaluations.**
*   **COMPLETED: Address the "ignoring return value of ‘size_t fread(void*, size_t, size_t, FILE*)’" warnings in `dblookup.c`.**

## Build System and Cross-Platform Compatibility:
*   **COMPLETED: Review and refine the `build_checkerboard.sh` script to ensure it correctly handles all source files and dependencies for cross-platform compilation.**
*   **COMPLETED: Ensure all Windows-specific code has been removed or replaced with cross-platform alternatives.**

## Testing and Debugging:
*   Develop comprehensive unit tests for core game logic, AI functions, and EGDB integration.
*   **COMPLETED: Robust logging and debugging mechanisms have been implemented, primarily through `GameManager::log` calls in critical sections of `GameManager.cpp` and `GeminiAI.cpp`, covering game state, AI search, EGDB interactions, and external engine communication. The `s_minLogLevel` in `GameManager` allows dynamic control of log verbosity via `CBoptions`.**

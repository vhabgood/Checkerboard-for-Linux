The bug where the AI makes suicidal moves has been addressed and the application has been recompiled. The executable `checkerboard_app` is now present.
The `evaluateBoard` function in `GeminiAI.cpp` was modified to include a material advantage component. This adds a penalty for having fewer pieces than the opponent, making the AI less likely to sacrifice its own pieces.
The EGDB (Endgame Database) and transposition table lookups, which were disabled for debugging, have been re-enabled. This should improve the AI's performance.

I believe the bug is fixed and the AI should now play more intelligently and avoid suicidal moves.
Added `m_transpositionTable.clear();` to the beginning of `GeminiAI::getBestMove` to clear the transposition table for each new search, preventing indefinite growth and improving performance.
Removed verbose `log_to_file` calls from `c_logic.cpp` to improve performance of move generation.
Refactored `makemovelist` in `c_logic.cpp` to use bitboard-based iteration for piece identification and move generation, improving performance.
Fixed a critical bug in `makemovelist` in `c_logic.cpp` where coordinate conversion from 8x8 to 12x12 board representation was incorrect, leading to all moves being reported as illegal. The `x` and `y` coordinates were being double-offset, causing out-of-bounds access or incorrect board state interpretation. This has been corrected by properly mapping 8x8 coordinates to 12x12 coordinates (`x_12x12 = x_8x8 + 2; y_12x12 = y_8x8 + 2;`) and consistently using these 12x12 coordinates for board access within the move generation logic.
Implemented mobility as a factor in the AI's evaluation function (`evaluateBoard` in `GeminiAI.cpp`). The `countLegalMoves` helper function was added to determine the number of legal moves for each side, and a bonus is now awarded for having greater mobility.
Added debug logging to `GameManager::handleSquareClick` to inspect coordinate values during move validation.
Added debug logging to `c_logic.cpp` within `get_legal_moves_c` after coordinate conversion to verify 0-7 range.
Fixed coordinate conversion in `makemovelist` within `c_logic.cpp` by directly converting `bit_pos` to `(x,y)` (column, row) consistent with the UI's top-left (0,0) coordinate system, resolving the y-coordinate inversion issue.

2025-12-23: [AI/EGDB] Integrated EGDB evaluation gradient.
- Added dbWinEval, AllKingsEval, white_tempo, and black_tempo to AIWorker.cpp.
- Updated AIWorker::evaluateBoard to perform EGDB lookups at search leaves.
- Finalized WLD mapping (0=LOSS, 1=DRAW, 2=WIN).

2025-12-24: Optimized search engine.
- Implemented Zobrist repetition detection to fix shuffling bug.
- Added NMP (Null Move Pruning), LMR (Late Move Reductions), and Aspiration Windows.
- Fixed critical multi-jump board simulation bug in find_captures_recursive.
- Corrected NegaMax sign error in EGDB evaluation logic.
- Enhanced king evaluation with mobility bonuses and trapped penalties.
- Improved UI status bar consistency for mate scores.

2025-12-25: Fixed EGDB driver and MTC decoding.
- Reverted EGDB block size to 1024 bytes in db_io.cpp and drivers to match index checkpoints.
- Updated parseindexfile_wld to correctly skip extra checkpoint values (BlockOffset and Value).
- Implemented block-boundary resync in dblookup_wld_internal to maintain alignment with index file.
- Increased cache capacity to 4096 blocks (4MB) to handle smaller 1024-byte units efficiently.
- Fixed MTC decoding to return 1 ply for thresholded results, distinguishing them from unknown values.
- Updated egdb_identify to correctly recognize dbN.cpr filenames and set appropriate types.
- Fixed MTC lookup indexing mismatch by switching from position_to_index_slice to get_board_index_mtc.
- Resolved MTC lookup failure for multi-block slices by fixing num_idx_blocks initialization in parseindexfile_mtc.
- Corrected SYMMETRY RETRY bug in dblookup_wld_internal to properly update piece counts and ranks.
- Enforced minimum 4MB cache size in DBManager to prevent out-of-bounds access with 4096-block capacity.
- Unified WLD driver initialization to handle RUNLEN, TUN_V1, and TUN_V2 types via egdb_open_wld_runlen.

2025-12-25: Achieved 100% successful EGDB lookups for 7-piece test.
- Resolved 'Decompression FAILED' errors by implementing brute-force decompression from slice start.
- Fixed absolute file offset calculation by correctly interpreting BASE block_id as 4096-byte units.
- Updated cache system to use 4096-byte blocks and 64-bit unique IDs to prevent collisions in large files.
- Optimized initialization by removing excessive logging and fixing an infinite loop in parseindexfile_mtc.
- Capped max pieces to 7 for testing to ensure stable memory usage during driver verification.

2025-12-25: Expanded EGDB driver to 10 pieces and improved AI move selection.
- Removed hardcoded 7-piece piece limit in WLD and MTC drivers to enable loading of 8, 9, and 10-piece database files.
- Verified successful loading of 54 MTC files and 90 WLD files (including split files).
- Improved AI move selection in EGDB winning positions: when MTC is missing, it now evaluates all winning moves and picks the one with the best heuristic evaluation.
- Confirmed 100% successful WLD lookups for 9-piece test positions.
- Fixed MTC lookup misses for king endgames by restoring correct absolute offset calculation from slice start.
- Verified MTC distance-to-win accuracy (10-16 plies) for 3-king endgames.

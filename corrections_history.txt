The `loword` typo in `dblookup.c` has been corrected, and the application now builds successfully without errors.

The `fpcount` logic in `db_init` was also confirmed to be correct in the current version of the file.

The next step is for the user to run the newly built `checkerboard_app` and provide the `app.txt` log. This log will be analyzed to verify the successful initialization of the Endgame Database (EGDB) and confirm that previous file access and preloading errors are resolved. If the game reaches an endgame state with 4 or fewer pieces, the log should also show `EGDB lookup` messages.
